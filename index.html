    <h2 id="current-issues">Current Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Crowded with buttons therefore sometimes it hard to find the button I
        need
      </li>
      <li>
        Unintuitive to set a custom cook time. What if I need to heat something
        for exactly 2 minutes and 53 seconds? I am unable to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Frozen Dinner option is not universal. Typically, frozen dinners have
        specific instuctions on how long to heat for. This button is deceiving.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a session is not finished, the time remain to cook will stay on
        screen. This could be misinterperated as the time causing confusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        After choosing a preset, user must put in additional information and
        press start. Some users would opt to just use a preset time and stop
        when ready rather than put in a bunch of information. A microwave is to
        heat up food quickly. More button inputs mean more time to heat up food.
      </li>

      Does the current interface make the common things easier?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes, however I have gotten use to how to operate my microwave. For someone
      else, it might not be as intuitive.
    </p>
    <h2 id="common-sequence-of-operation">Common Sequence of Operation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>User places food into microwave.</li>
      <li>User chooses approximate preset minute time to cook food.</li>
      <li>
        User waits for cook time to finish or stop the cooking before cook time
        is finished.
      </li>
      <li>
        (Optional) If food needs to heat longer, the user continues to heat in
        30 second intervals.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2
      id="how-does-the-microwave-support-the-user-figure-out-how-to-make-it-work"
    >
      How does the microwave support the user figure out how to make it work?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The microwave display has small indicators to tell the user what is going
      on such as indicating the user has to input an amount, and flashing the
      time if the user has time remaining to cook.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-does-the-microwave-provide-feedback-to-the-user">
      How does the microwave provide feedback to the user?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When a button is pressed on the microwave, the microwave beeps once. When
      the microwave is finished cooking, the microwave plays 3 long beeps. The
      microwave also has a small display at the top showing cook time, time, and
      necessary input.

      What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Possible to mistake remaining cook time for clock time</li>
      <li>Triggering preset cook minutes when trying input custom cook time</li>
      <li>Unintentionally pressing wrong button due to clustered interface</li>
      <li>
        Mistaking add 30 seconds button with the stop/clear button due to
        similar design
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-improvement-can-be-made">What improvement can be made?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce the number of button inputs</li>
      <li>Distinguish +30 seconds button from stop button</li>
      <li>Simplify putting a custom cook time</li>
      <li>Remove unnecessary features</li>
